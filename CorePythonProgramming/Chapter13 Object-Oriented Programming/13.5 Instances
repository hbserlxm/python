### 13.5.2 __init__ "Constructor"Method

When the class is invoked,the first step in the instantiation process is to create the instance object.Once the object is available,Python 
checks if an __init__() method has been implemented.If __init__() has been implemented, then that special method is invoked and the instance object 
passed in as the first argument(self),just like a standard method call.Any augument passed to the class invocation call are passed on to __init__().
