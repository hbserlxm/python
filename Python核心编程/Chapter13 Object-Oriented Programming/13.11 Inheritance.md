###  13.11.2 overriding Methods through Inheritance

```python
class P(object):
  def foo(self):
    print ('Hi, I am P')
>>> p = P()
>>> p.foo()
Hi, I am P-foo()

class C(P):
  def foo(self):
    print ('Hi, I am C')
>>> c = C()
>>> c.foo()
Hi, I am C
```
C overrided P's method `foo()`,because C defines its own foo() methods.

To invoke base class method,you need to explicitly call the base class method and do **it in the overidden method(you need the parameter self)** 
or use `super()` method
```python
class C(P):
  def foo(self):
    P.foo(self)
    print ('Hi, I am C')

# use  super() method
class C(P):
  def foo(self):
    super(C, self).foo()
    print 'Hi, I am C-foo()'  
```

if you override `__init__` ,it will not invoke base class `__init__`
(In Java ,the base class constructor always gets called(first) in derived class constructors.)

```python
class P(object):
  def __init__(self):
  print "calling P's constructor"
class C(P):
  def __init__(self):
  print "calling C's constructor"
>>> c = C()
calling C's constructor
```
The advantage of using `super()` is that you don't need to give any base class name explicitly.This means that 
if you change the class hierarchy,you only need to change one line(the *class* statement itself) rather than tracking through what could be a 
large amount of code in a class to find all mentions of what os now the old class name.
